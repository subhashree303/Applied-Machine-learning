"Subject: otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute  otc bbalert gdvi  news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website !  www . gdvi . net  otc bb  alert  spectacular operating results momentum  continues  sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million  99 . 8 %  revenue increase  278 % net  income increase  154 %  stockholders equity increase  79 %  increase in assets  $ 8  million order backlog  $ 50  million manufacturing capacity  overview  global diversified industries operates in the modular  building construction industry , and strategically targets the  california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in  central  california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art  manufacturing facility .  throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building  its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a  state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the  requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth .  through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million  capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state  of  california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to  become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the  west coast .  gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion  school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by  california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion  an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before  the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and  subsequently invests in those companies .  global diversified has taken numerous strategic  development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating  strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive  growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with  previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum  businesses .  in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue  projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state  approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit  facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing  facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition  candidates through its aggressive growth plan .  profile  gdvi is a holding company that currently  operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a  modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work  and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and  manufacturing of modular type structures .  its principal customer base is currently educational  ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and  municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of  portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two -  story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures  are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved  building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications  administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .  global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing  educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback  clause . the state of  california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular  classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful  bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities  portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the  originating school district . this process saves school districts  valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .  a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may  have access to future business for up to five years , depending on  the term of the piggyback contract .  the strategic focus on california schools  since 1998 ,  california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new  classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .  there are five compelling reasons for this trend :  modular  classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )  they cost  significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )  they offer  greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings  they are easier  to finance  they provide  financing incentives  to cope with population growth , the state department of  education estimates that  california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the  next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .  due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout  the california education sector , public and private schools are  expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their  additional classroom requirements over the next four years .  the california schools budget crisis  on  november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond  proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by  california  voters .  this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school  districts throughout the state .  a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the  voters on the march 2004 .  these bond measures are about three times higher than the  record $ 9 . 2 billion bond  california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these  bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which  include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular  classroom construction and renovations .  money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and  private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at  community colleges and other institutions of higher learning  throughout  california .  gdvi business infrastructure  among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated ,  state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes  equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are  specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular  structures .  gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking  to add to its workforce as demand increases .  operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square  foot operating structure .  wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,  designs and manufactures the buildings  wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles  installation and building renovation .  symbol otc . bb  gdvi  recent price 13 . 5 cents  management team  philip hamilton , ceo and president  mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful  background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served  as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this  company from inception into one of  californias  largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools  and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter  industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater ,  california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the  company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales  of $ 50 , 000 , 000 .  adam de bard , vice president  mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the  manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as  vice president and chief  information officer of pacesetter industries .  ronald kilpatrick , director of finance  mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic  and international development and management of major corporations .  he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides  venture capital to projects in the  pacific rim .  recent headlines  global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to  increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility  pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new  order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery  pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 )  wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi  and geoi  pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 )  wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle  pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 )  global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets  from california modular company  pr newswire ( thu , may 26 )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division  implementing its fourth production line  pr newswire ( thu , may 19 )  talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton ,  president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc .  primezone media network ( tue , may 17 )  stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified  industries , inc .  primezone media network ( mon , may 16 )  global diversified industries ' modular division billings total  $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

 - copper ;  - gold ;  - lead ;  - nickel ;  - silver ;  - tin ;  - zinc ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward  prices for each metal .  - copper concentrate ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating tc charges .  - cocoa beans ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward  prices for cocoa beans .  therefore these 10 curves will drive the risk : price curves for aluminium ,  copper , gold , lead , nickel , silver , tin , zinc and cocoa beans plus tc curve  for copper concentrate .  assumptions and simplifications :  - for each metal we are going to use a single price curve or all types of  products ( physical , financial , lme traded , comex traded , scrap , alloy , stock ,  etc . ) ;  - delta , gamma approach for risk on options  , positions ;  components required to implement v @ r model :  - current forward prices available from mercur ;  - current implied volatilities available through reuters ;  - current positions from mercur ;  - history of prices required to calculate factor loadings and correlations  across commodities ;  methodology  version _ 1 a will be based on risk matrix approach . we will calculate principal  components for each metal and cocoa beans to take in account the correlations  along the term structure . we will also calculate the correlations across  commodities based on prompt month prices history for last 3 months .  portfolio hierarchy  each position will be assigned to one of the following portfolios under the  whole portfolio agg - metals :  - mg metal  - mg metal  - mg metall recycling gmbh , ffm ;

"Subject: strictly private .  gooday ,  with warm heart my friend , i send you my greetings , and i hope this letter meets you in good time .  it will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally . however , i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction , which i propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity . i have kept it to myself for a long time , and now i need to act , as time is not on my side . i want you to open - heartedly read through and give me your most needed support . i got your address from an internet directory , in my search for a contact . i apologize if this is not acceptable to you . the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance .  my name is donald phiri , the farm supervisor and personal assistant to mr . david stevens , a very popular and rich farmer from macheke , zimbabwe . my master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of april 2001 , due to the land dispute and political situation in my country , as a result of my master ' s financial support for the mdc ( movement for democratic change ) , the main opposition party to president mugabe ' s party , zimbabwe african national union patriotic front ( zanu - pf ) . for more information on my master ' s murder , you may check the amnesty international country report on zimbabwe for the year 2001 .  when the pressure on white farmers started in zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by president mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers , my master forsaw the danger ahead , he then closed his major bank accounts , and together , we went to johannesburg , south africa to deposit the sum of $ 14 . 5 million ( fourten million , five hundred thousand usdollars ) , in a private security company , for safety . this money was deposited in a box in my name , as my master was being secretive with his name , as the south african government of thambo mbeki is in support of president mugabe ' s actions . the box is labeled as gemstones . my master had planned to use this money for the purchase of lands , new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in botswana . he has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from europe . my master is divorced , and his wife valerie , and only child , diana have relocated to bradford , !  en !  gland for 9 years now .  i am currently in the netherlands where i am seeking political asylum . i have now decided to transfer my master ' s money into an account for security and safety reasons . this is why i am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left . you have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you .  if you accept to assist me , all i want you to do for me , is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the netherlands , and then we will transfer the money into an account . you may open a new account for this purpose . i have applied to the security company to transfer the box from south africa to their branch here , which they have done .  to legally process the claim of the box , i will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative , and deliver the box to you . i have with me , the certificate used to deposit the box , which we will need for claiming the box .  for valuable assistance , i am offering you 10 % ( $ 1 , 450 , 000 ) of the total money . i have also set aside 1 % ( $ 145 , 000 ) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction , and 4 % ( $ 580 , 000 ) , will be given to charity in my master ' s name i will give 25 % ( $ 3 , 625 , 000 ) to valerie and diana , after my share of the money has been transfered back to me . when they grant my asylum application , my share of the money ( 85 % ) , will be transfered back to me , into an account i will solely own . i also intend to start up a business then . if you have knowledge of farming business in your country , or other areas of possible business investment that i may be interested in , please inform me , so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being .  please , i want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction .  i look forward to your reply and co - operation , and i am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you .  yours sincerely ,  donald phiri .  - - - -  this sf . net email is sponsored by : thinkgeek  welcome to geek heaven .  http : / / thinkgeek . com / sf  spamassassin -

"Subject: alliance info alert - ferc reporting  attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly  alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting ,  followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings .  in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203  merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be  determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next  steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are  provided below .  ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process  ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as  discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the  notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products .  according to ferc , the draft order :  - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ;  - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses .  - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns ; and  - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements .  the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register .  commissioner reaction :  comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the  rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the  federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before ,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis .  comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet  sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality .  comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would  improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt ,  massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s  concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail  competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry .  chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their  own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to  preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably .  nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and  deadlines for resolution / implementation .  in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000  compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found  that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the  iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve  market by april 2001 , as the iso requested .  commissioner reaction :  comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an "" imperfect  solution , "" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls .  hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted .  in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy  transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service  to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ;  stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing  the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) .  = = recent ferc filings = =  ( 1 ) rto developments  * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring ,  reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s  july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the  commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s  filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from  the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 .  * el segundo power filed a motion "" requesting order on request for rehearing  by date certain "" in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the  rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability  under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 .  * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its  administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november  22 , 2000 .  * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the  sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the  elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .

"Subject: dhabol  jeff ,  we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in india  published by the financial times .  the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting  millions of people .  one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due  to power  shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced  by the dhabol plant ( expensive as it may be ) . the power cut affected 230  million people .  the second article is enron specific .  vince  asia - pacific : power failure hits north india  financial times ; jan 3 , 2001  by angus donald  tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern india  yesterday after a power grid breakdown .  electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the  capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored  by the end of the day , according to power grid  officials .  the associated chambers of commerce and industry  ( assocham ) , a  leading business organisation , expressed "" deep concern ""  and called for a  mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  "" cripple the economy "" .  the power failure across eight indian states , including  new delhi , disrupted  train services , water supplies and the telephone network  and forced  hospitals to switch to emergency generators .  the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides  electricity for 226 m  people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana ,  punjab , uttar pradesh ,  himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu  and kashmir .  a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh ,  india ' s most  populous state , caused an overload of power on other  lines , which then  failed as well .  trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were  damaged . new delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before  its own power supply could be engaged .  "" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is  most likely to be a  technical failure , but we will investigate why it  happened , "" suresh prabhu ,  the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust  of india .  india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big  problem . thirty per  cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according  to analysts . in new  delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .  two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours .  assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s  inefficient power  sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further . ""  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 . "" ft "" and "" financial times ""  are trademarks of the financial times . privacy policy | terms jan 3 , 2001  by khozem merchant  enron , the us energy producer and a constant target of  criticism in india , is  hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a  profiteering  multinational .  its "" myth and reality "" offensive in local newspapers  follows the west indian  state of maharashtra ' s decision to review the tariff it  pays the texas - based  company , whose dollars 2 . 2 bn electricity generating  plant at dabhol is  india ' s biggest single foreign investment .  maharashtra ' s tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times  greater than that charged by other independent power  producers ( ipps ) .  the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the  dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel . the state also pays  a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m ( dollars 21 m ) a month ,  reflecting the  huge project cost and , controversially , irrespective of  consumption .  a showdown looks inevitable , reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that  damaged india ' s appeal to foreign investors . a former  official of the world  bank , which has criticised the deal , says enron is  emerging "" as the east  india company of the 21 st century "" - a reference to the  british trader that  colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th  century .  the stand - off is the latest blot on india ' s power  sector . the uk ' s powergen  and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently ,  frustrated by long approval  procedures , inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher  returns elsewhere .  "" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six  percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india  general manager  of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat  to china light &  power of hong kong .  india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity  must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since  1992 , ipps have  added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under  construction . this is  insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic  growth .  enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,  winning fast - track project  approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a  dollars 1 . 87 bn plant  of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas ( lng ) ,  will be completed this year . only two of seven other  fast - track proposals  have achieved financial closure .  from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating  in maharashtra ' s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister  of the successor  government , says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable .  enron , whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists , wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment . enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,  such as energy , gas  and bandwidth .  to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed  this year . it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas . and it is  laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity .  in any event , enron believes it has a watertight  contract . it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and  industrial hub , as an  unreliable destination for investment .  mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor , which  threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options  are limited .  scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders .  maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility  and enron ' s main  client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent  of dabhol ' s output . yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take  has averaged 60  per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power .  one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the  tariff would be  rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but  with off - take a  third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and  often higher . in  october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take  was about 49 per  cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,  run on cheaper  lng , starts .  these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a 30 per  cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer .  enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,  which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power .  reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as  transmission and  distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and  technical losses , is  overdue . "" given the limited resources , money would be  better spent on t & d  rather than on new plant , "" says oliver blackaby ,  managing director of n m  rothschild in india , which is advising karnataka on the  privatisation of its  distribution network .  for the moment , attention is fixed on enron ' s ability to  satisfy the  competing interests of investors and clients . as sanjay  bhatnagar , chief  executive officer of enron india , said in a recent trade  magazine , one of the  key lessons learned from phase 2 is "" having flexibility  to deal with  externalities "" .  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 .

"Subject: california update 1 / 31 / 01  please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh  ( x 39510 ) with additional questions .  executive summary  an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long - term contracts ( price and term ) .  the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan  to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds .  audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless  appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes .  davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy .  davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a  ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate  hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state .  legislation and bail out  bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations  yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure ,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill  is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said  davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign .  bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of  the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power .  according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court  battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that  california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity  charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot  initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes .  a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would  still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 %  of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important  sense .  making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates .  the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think  there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves ,  something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned .  long - term contracts  a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying  contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one  official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say ,  ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy . ""  bankruptcy  because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that  california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) .  we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los  angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at  the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis .  audit results and ballot initiatives  markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt - issuing binge .  the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  "" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep  spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors  also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company ,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks .  "" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put  it yesterday .  what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult .  keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full  public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate .  court battle  thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in  mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt .  pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid  so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power .  although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until  february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline  approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand ,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily . ""  one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a  settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps  even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and  get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme  court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think  the creditors will be quite that patient .

"Subject: california on the brink - - cera alert  cera alert : december 13 , 2000  title : california on the brink  cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas  california on the brink  the california stalemate  california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california ' s utilities , the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .  western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis ,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied  the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end  their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .  the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is  possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail  to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .  in the six months since california ' s supply shortfall began plaguing western  markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .  rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed ,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated  changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a  challenging siting and permitting process .  medicine worse than the illness  several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of  california ' s electric market woes . *  * challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power  plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities .  * price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .  * repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including  the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development .  * calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the  ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development .  * facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .  cera ' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west  are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of  older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .  california ' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state .  despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .  in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage .  the road to recovery  there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall :  * encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal  some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?  * stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build .  * move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence  ( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with  the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move  toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if  they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments .  * encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although  originally a feature of california ' s market design , most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response .  * encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "" boom bust "" characteristic of  the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement ,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )  future price volatility .  * avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to  be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term  contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the  market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to  do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its  course .  * allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions .  * free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa  power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"" it ' s a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define  their roles differently , "" said ken weilerstein , an analyst at gartner group  inc . in stamford , conn . enron ' s plan also could help enterprise - level users  get additional benefits along with the storage capacity they ' re renting , such  as security and disaster recovery support , he added .  ravi thuraisingham , director of global bandwidth risk management at enron  broadband services , said the new offering won ' t include additional security  features . but enron does plan to standardize on a set of ssp services and  bundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities ,  he said .  initially , enron - - which had total revenue of $ 101 billion last year - -  expects to charge users monthly fees of $ 25 to $ 55 per gigabyte of managed  storage , depending on market conditions and the length of time a company  expects to need the capacity . "" we ' re there to try to discover a market  clearing price , "" said thuraisingham , adding that the service is tentatively  due to go online in the third quarter .  enron said it has already signed best buy co . , one of the leading retailers  of consumer electronics , computers and software in the u . s . , to buy the  storage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management  application through storagenetworks . connecting users such as best buy to  available storage could take anywhere from three days to three months ,  according to thuraisingham .  under enron ' s plan , storage capacity owned by participating ssps will be  connected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company  currently trades telecommunications bandwidth . enron said it has 18 switching  centers , or "" pooling points , "" in the u . s . , and another seven overseas .  at first , the company plans to focus its attention on ssps in boston and  other metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily  installed . but even there , thuraisingham said , enron is "" pretty much in the  initial stages of getting ssps up to speed on what the market is about . ""  enron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since  the spring of 1999 . later that year , it also launched a web site called  enrononline that oversees the trading of natural gas , electricity and other  commodities . that quickly became the world ' s largest e - commerce site and is  now said to be processing more than $ 1 billion worth of transactions daily .  norman levine  enron broadband services  713 - 853 - 5010  norman _ levine @ enron . net",0,computerworld article fyi several errors like brokering report given fact guy clue enron companies like came okay pr group marketing effort enron market maker message ravi forwarded ravi thuraisingham enron communications shelly mansfield ravi thuraisingham enron communications enron communications cc subject computerworld article shelly mansfield enron broadband services office fax pager cellular forwarded shelly mansfield enron communications norman levine shelly mansfield enron communications enron communications cc subject computerworld article following computerworld article link enron seeks broker storage deals users ssps lucas mearian technology service providers long talking data storage utility sold open marketplace like electricity natural gas little done pool market resources order hawk surplus disk array capacity exactly subsidiary houston based energy communications conglomerate enron corp launching business business exchange said seek match spare capacity owned storage service providers ssp corporate users want able quickly scale amounts storage available enron broadband services week announced already signed deal waltham mass based storagenetworks inc negotiating similar agreements least six ssps successful analysts said enron business proposition could go far toward generating set operating standards emerging ssp business market mix small large players companies define roles differently said ken weilerstein analyst gartner group inc stamford conn enron plan also could help enterprise level users get additional benefits along storage capacity renting security disaster recovery support added ravi thuraisingham director global bandwidth risk management enron broadband services said new offering include additional security features enron plan standardize set ssp services bundle disaster recovery communications bandwidth capabilities said initially enron total revenue billion last year expects charge users monthly fees per gigabyte managed storage depending market conditions length time company expects need capacity try discover market clearing price said thuraisingham adding service tentatively due go online third quarter enron said already signed best buy co one leading retailers consumer electronics computers software u buy storage capacity needs support customer relationship management application storagenetworks connecting users best buy available storage could take anywhere three days three months according thuraisingham enron plan storage capacity owned participating ssps connected existing network switching hubs company currently trades telecommunications bandwidth enron said switching centers pooling points u another seven overseas first company plans focus attention ssps boston metropitan areas necessary networking plumbing easily installed even thuraisingham said enron pretty much initial stages getting ssps speed market enron managing online trades telecommunications bandwidth since spring later year also launched web site called enrononline oversees trading natural gas electricity commodities quickly became world largest e commerce site said processing billion worth transactions daily norman levine enron broadband services norman levine enron net

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .

' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just  mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how  should the measurements be presented , etc . ) .  in short  - rtfm

"Subject: organizational changes  to : enron north america corp .  from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon  in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the  implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the  continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our  people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,  and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both  within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the  corporate goal of fostering   b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a  broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers  including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and  mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,  textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream  coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .  downstream coverage / origination  as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that  the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both  ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand  its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial  solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron  corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function  will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy  commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities  but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,  plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional  capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels  groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper  will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s  leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three  sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .",0,organizational changes enron north america corp cliff baxter kevin hannon july part enron north america ena reorganization implementation

"Subject: capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit  breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit ,  virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 ,  geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise ,  on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation .  the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data .  capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company .  in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 .  as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area .  a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market .  conclusion  development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream .  for additional information , visit  investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -

"Subject: transport model  andy ,  the scale effect in the transport model can be explained .  i use a european option to do the illustration .  i raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount , use the fuel  percentage to adjust the strike .  the net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up .  if the fuel percentage is not very high , the option premium actually  increases with the level , although the  intrinsic value decreases .  if the fuel percentage is very high ( > 8 % ) , then we see a decreasing option  price .  in the transport deal , fuel change is often below 5 % , so you will not see a  decreasing spread option price  when nymex moves up . so i think the transport model still does what it  should do .  zimin  in the following exmaple , i used r = 6 % , vol = 20 % , t = 100 days , see spreadsheet  for details .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by zimin lu / hou / ect on 10 / 20 / 2000 01 : 24 pm  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  zimin lu  10 / 20 / 2000 10 : 45 am  to : andrew h lewis / hou / ect @ ect  cc : colleen sullivan / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect  subject : level effect in transport  andy ,  the following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport  valuation .  i add an "" nymex add - on "" to both delivery and receipt price curve before fuel  adjustment , keep everything else the same . the transport value ( pv of the  spread options )  increases when nymex add - on increases .  i can visit you at your desk if you have further question .  zimin",0,transport model andy scale effect transport model explained use european option illustration raise underlying strike price amount use fuel percentage adjust strike net result intrinsic value decreases level goes fuel percentage high option premium actually increases level although intrinsic value decreases fuel percentage high see decreasing option price transport deal fuel change often see decreasing spread option price nymex moves think transport model still zimin following exmaple used r vol days see spreadsheet details forwarded zimin lu hou ect pm zimin lu andrew h lewis hou ect ect cc colleen sullivan hou ect ect stinson gibner hou ect ect subject level effect transport andy following spread sheet domenstrates leve effect transport valuation add nymex add delivery receipt price curve fuel adjustment keep everything else transport value pv spread options increases nymex add increases visit desk question zimin

"Subject: the lure of the san  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  03 / 14 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e - business is changing how businesses value information . information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,  information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial .  companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they  often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models .  today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other  application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .  this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because  the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .  third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,  because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files .  this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .  sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,  centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to  remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back - up operations .  using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -  performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices  can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .  yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still  developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs .  given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  amy larsen decarlo is an analyst with enterprise management

( this is why  increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for  the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each  plant ' s aggregate values are reported .  i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a  homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql  query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making  appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood  documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i  can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine  at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,  so it may be available now .  let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,  michael  > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > >  michael ,  i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am  currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and  experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard  from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and  consequently the person to contact in case of problems .  i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide  the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and  system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each  station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea  marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations  according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station  detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :  for each hour , for each generating station :  "" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -  vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]  this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal  station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a  station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i  have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non  of the costs there match my results .  do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which  outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?  it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .  regards  karolina",0,henwood query hi karolina yes might productive talk phone given time difference plan tomorrow friday pdt pm bdt number states give number call back get hung meeting something situation complicated fact marginal cost set capacity increment plant margin particular hour constructing stack increments plant may scattered throughout stack based respective incremental heat rates increment heat rates must strictly increasing model results capacity increments however available output plant aggregate values reported construct stack particular hour answer question homer city ny plant studying years ago attached sql query import ms access thing making appropriate modifications year hour etc unfortunately henwood documentation output variables existed created query really tell represent anymore acquaintance mine entergy lobbying get henwood provide documentation may available let talk maybe help michael karolina potter lon ect enron michael analyst paul mead continental power trading group london currently working project requires use emss experience difficulties interpreting output results steven leppard research group gave name expert system consequently person contact case problems running simulations dutch market asked provide traders front end screen graphs order interpret numerical results one graphs show hourly generation stack system marginal cost run cost based scenarios sort station hourly generation need marginal cost knowledge though marginal cost generated systems marginal unit transarea marginal units query marg cost unit therefore sorting stations according cost calculated based outputs station detail hour query calculation follows hour generating station marginal cost mwh generation cost oo generation mwh vom cost mwh thought would include fuel cost start costs however marginal station get stack result calculation station given marginal station field transarea marginal units query also looked transarea data hr table transarea data table non costs match results happen know formula used determine marg cost outputs using obtain right results might easier could discuss issue phone case could please send direct telephone number struggling understanding going would appreciate help much regards karolina

"Subject: pserc denver meeting  vince ,  the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting  and boring . pserc has 11 school members and 30 industry members . its research  program consists of three stems : markets , transmission and distribution ,  and systems . ( enron ' s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem . )  in morning of the first day , researchers from universities  presented their project proposals . i found some of them  quite interesting . for example , shmuel oren , fernando alvarado ,  tim mount ( of cornell ) propose to study "" market redesign : incorporating  the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market  design , "" shijie deng , s . oren et al propose to study "" power asset  valuation model in a market - based and reliability - constrained electric  power system . "" the first got funded but the second did not .  in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their  own discussion . i went to the academic discussion and lance the  industry one . i hope my presence there did not make things worse , for  the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion .  the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants .  the proposal process goes as follows : researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee ( no industry participantion , it seems  to me ) ,  each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 . the  selected  proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry . industry then  gets to vote which proposals get funded . however , some researchers were  very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process . there were  accusation of self - ranking , communication between stem committee and  member schools breaking down , and so on . some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it  ( the arguement was "" then it was a waste of our time to write proposals "" ,  which i found quite amusing ) .  all in all , i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers . pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process , which is hard to believe . also ,  the communication among university researchers , between stem committee  and member schools , and most importantly , between researchers and industry ,  are not smooth as all .  since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members , the "" right ""  projects may not get funded . too many participants also make the decision  process very indecisive and quite painful to watch ( lance can comment on  this better ) . they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which  made the voting a less authoritive .  i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc ( price tag is  $ 40 , 000  per company per year ) . if we find some projects interesting , we can sponsor  the schools in the form of summer interns , the schools claim that most of the  fund  goes to support students anyway .  alex",0,pserc denver meeting vince pserc meeting lance went interesting boring pserc school members industry members research program consists three stems markets transmission distribution systems enron interests probably lie mainly first stem morning first day researchers universities presented project proposals found quite interesting example shmuel oren fernando alvarado tim mount cornell propose study market redesign incorporating lessons learned actual experiences enhancing market design shijie deng oren et al propose study power asset valuation model market based reliability constrained electric power system first got funded second afternoon industry academic separated discussion went academic discussion lance industry one hope presence make things worse discussion revealed lot organizational chaos confusion proposal screen process got lot heat participants proposal process goes follows researchers first write short proposal appropriate stem committee industry participantion seems committee ranks proposal selects top selected proposals expanded present industry industry gets vote proposals get funded however researchers unhappy initial ranking selection process accusation self ranking communication stem committee member schools breaking even asking sort assurance project funded even wrting arguement waste time write proposals found quite amusing found process taken seriously enough university researchers pserc established years still proper proposal screen process hard believe also communication among university researchers stem committee member schools importantly researchers industry smooth since proposals voted industry members right projects may get funded many participants also make decision process indecisive quite painful watch lance comment better also wanted spread fund among schools made voting less authoritive believe enron get much returns join pserc price tag per company per year find projects interesting sponsor schools form summer interns schools claim fund goes support students anyway alex

"Subject: eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading  strategy  please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some  typos .  greg and john ,  i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially  because in a trending market  we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose  market move from  $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread  is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5  trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is  ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading  volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one  trade , the total mtm is  - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that  particular day .  therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades , we can be more  profitable as a market maker .  i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .  i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3 . almost in all  cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for  dollar amount change in millions .  please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .  regards ,  zimin lu  x 36388  as compared to",0,eol wti historical trade simulation profitable trading strategy please ignor previous mail regarding issue contains typos greg john found reducing volume per trade increasing daily number trades keeping total volume per day constant profitable partially trending market lose less money following market closely example suppose market move per trade volume bbl half bid offer spread simplicity take trades short positions total mtm day total trading volume bbl short per trade volume bbl take one trade total mtm thus net difference two trading strategies particular day therefore seems reducing per trade volume increasing number trades profitable market maker rerun scenario stinson sent dec used per trade volume bbl reduce number trade increasing number trades factor almost cases saw increased profitability see colume marked change dollar amount change millions please let stinson know thoughts regards zimin lu x compared

whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than  the model . we brief the traders and field questions then provide our report  to the fundamentals group .  * * in the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the avn and  mrf to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand  models or at least be able to give them our "" best pick "" of guidance and how  we feel things may deviate from that pick .  1030 am : obtain the uk met 6 - 10 and 1 - 5 day forecasts . provide comment for  uk trading .  1200 : uk trading / crude and products / weather derivatives : prepare a full  qualitative analysis of oz models ( mrf / nogaps / canadian / ensembles ) . produce a  6 to 10 day europe forecast and make any needed adjustments to the 1 to 5 day  forecast . produce the global weather report including a global executive  summary ; analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6  to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for  european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally  a "" port status report "" describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide  ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz  models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day  forecast for uk trading .  1330 ( mon -

"Subject: re : convergence of the research model  i was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of  the  number of simulations we use . this question , i think , is not so important  when we  calculate credit reserve , because the assumptions underlying our model are  pretty  rough anyway ( here i mean the assumptions regarding price processes ,  correlations , etc . )  this question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating  sensitivities of the  credit reserve to various factors . when the magnitude of the sensitivity is  comparable  to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve , what is the accuracy of  such sensitivity ?  i performed a numerical experiment where i calculated the expected loss  for a simple portfolio with one counterparty ( sithe ind power ) for different  number of simulations ( 10 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 , 100000 ) using old research  credit model .  you can see how the result converges and the relative error ( compared to the  result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate ) in  the  attached file .  tanya .",0,convergence research model curious accuracy credit reserve model function number simulations use question think important calculate credit reserve assumptions underlying model pretty rough anyway mean assumptions regarding price processes correlations etc question becomes essential talk calculating sensitivities credit reserve various factors magnitude sensitivity comparable accuracy calculation credit reserve accuracy sensitivity performed numerical experiment calculated expected loss simple portfolio one counterparty sithe ind power different number simulations using old research credit model see result converges relative error compared result simulations assumed accurate attached file tanya

"" while bansal declined comment on the board  decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to  holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were  possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the  state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head ,  maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to  dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior  mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india  managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources  said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that  it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in  fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february  bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international  lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the  multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state  government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in  london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue  a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra  state electricity board and the state government .  & the board has authorised  wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that  the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling  provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  8 a state government  source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure  from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of  the board  , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who  had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice .  the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not  be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the  lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources  said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the  enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond  conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the  maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of  crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to  nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per  cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose  vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives  were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party .  the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting  was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against  the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc  invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s  counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became  overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated  on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of  electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against  this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" ,  a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and  refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the  political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration  between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot .  international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones  led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical  that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite  the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a  preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the  authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc  president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer  notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the  london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual  obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has  failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with  the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s  debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders  are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is .  however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a  messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to  phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect  their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  *  like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like  idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5  per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made  clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a )  there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to  dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore  rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of  power .  while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the  view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders  were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is  despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination  given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers  pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and  protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped  in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is  backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that  phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  *  even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the  segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to  sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial  liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc  president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of  power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp ,  has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it  intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held  in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo  neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a   +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the  next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb  began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for  power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after  mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply  power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24  million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on  thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india  to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to  suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary  termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to  the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision  as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to  recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would  be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the  company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated ,  the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides  paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .   +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be  one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power  secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  ,  s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore ,  and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project  was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of  completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which  is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company  to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the  company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the  meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had  strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices  for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both  directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm  lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in  london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various  arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in  isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the  mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step  typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war ,  coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was  viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire  because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the  company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around  rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night  authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has  decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that  the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in  reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death  of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the  developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole  committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would  only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot  of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some  arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially  disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions  on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the  offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not  see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out  the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to  authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc  would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the  interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today  he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the  strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation  was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister ,  mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre  rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the  centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and  a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial  institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to  convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of  indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee  either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised  the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state  electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet ,  considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured  renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though  foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial  institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over  the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders '  consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project .  the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice  was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a  move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the  financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the  project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms .  institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package ,  which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board  has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the  meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the  project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their  views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included  the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings .  ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high  and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our  exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any  plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the  lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be  completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' '  he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india ,  where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company  officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination  notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project  favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa .  ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that  would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was  echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the  government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however ,  added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and  dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would  be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three  arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues  amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december  2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the  march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest  payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the  managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to  terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken  at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an  ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation  clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official  said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice  was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the  official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to  a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the  termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary  termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or  such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a  view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to  all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier  persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination  notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company  to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in  favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however ,  domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa  is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the  parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and  central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao  deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the  state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance  minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now  have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the  official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134  crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was  paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of  rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior  mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the  centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the  dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve  a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company  management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could  inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision  to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was  taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government  representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested  party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal ,  declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express  our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh  decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s  decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the  mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its  tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can  formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state  government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state  electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to  authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did  not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping  of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger  position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm  itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its  control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb ,  the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the  dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s  decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the  mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s  subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state  electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination  notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol  power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop  sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65  per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m  lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders  discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability ,  if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a  termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for  six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the  centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on  foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows  into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb  officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate  policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the  decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped  power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers  at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of  events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb  officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on  wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide  bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up  at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told  the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a  move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold  around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in  terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game  because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions  are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike  those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government  officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding  up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power  company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to  serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9  billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of  dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday  in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state  electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was  itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before  the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress  party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu ,  who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre  is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its  counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political  force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of  exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr  suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per  cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not  have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent  share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount  in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that  termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the  total of one years  , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would  not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that  the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it  is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to  prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc  , s  board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister ,  padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr  vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend  and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april .  however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given  its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary .  the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff ,  with enron  , s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb  technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however ,  they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the  only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also  represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this  could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities  could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over  the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march  2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put  up a brave face on enron  , s decision saying there would not be any adverse  effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported  from new delhi .   & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or  foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact  on fdi in power sector ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when  asked about dpc  , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination  notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision ,  prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs   & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as  european nations in the power sector .  & in fact not only the power minister but  also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power  and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  8  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor ,  managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given  complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the  authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor  will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a  meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state  officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman  vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the  meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills  are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some  money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there  was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the  london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi )  representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could  not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the  decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to  wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to  take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state  government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy  company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to  both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going  to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday  apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra ,  but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision  to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying  the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not  received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details ,  we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the  proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing  director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said  he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to  look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc .  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state  government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the  maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project ,  but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power  company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh  said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social  reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the  committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he  termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil  mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state  electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with  power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole  committee and the center will also depute its representative on the  renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh  saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its  expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when  pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite  state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister  said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary  amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so  that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a  patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state  departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry  within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the  dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise ,  though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to  do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the  matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that  the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power  project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel  slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are  waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the  state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come  back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are  definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to  predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still  on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound  up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the  terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government .  however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he  indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses  if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on  wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project  once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he  deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily  indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been  riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for  the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to  time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the  project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with  enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic  front government inherited the controversial project when the governments  changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the  osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government  have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with  enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that .  they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both  sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still  manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he  added .",0,enron india newsdesk april th newsclips fyi news articles indian press

"Subject: ees operational risk  per our conversation , here is the model that i have for simon . the notes  that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking  for volume numbers . the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers .  briefly , the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and  noncredit risk . ideally , this would be anything that effects npv of the  deal . however , i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that  effect the time and amount of the eam volumes . even here , such a problem set  is quite large . if you glance at the spreadsheet model , you will notice that  there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes .  if we are to do this rigorously , then it is necessary to tear apart ees ' s  business model , and although such an attempt to do so would be noble , the  scope of such an excercise may be too large . we need a clear definition of  ees operational risk .  briefly , from the ees deals that i have looked at , two things drive their  profit : a long term bet that power prices will go down , and that we can  improve the facility through various enhancements . each of these may be  gleaned from the spreadsheet , as well as the assumptions regarding the  funding of the facility improvements and so on . 95 % of the savings is  assumed to come from power , and 5 % from gas . ( the effeciency gain may not be  explicitly given ) . if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains ,  then it would be simple [ in principle ] to determine a distribution , and hence  a distribution of eam volumes , npv ' s , etc . at this time , i understand that  rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains , but my knowledge is  quite sketchy . jay hachen may have more info .  if i get a chance , i will try to see if i can do a "" proof of concept ""  excercise , but i have a late january deadline on something else .  another point : even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet  model , ees has chosen to book things differently . i do not have a thorough  understanding of their it systems , but at least in principle , if we can do  this for the spreadsheet model , then we can do it in their it environment  ( data are data are data ) . they may book efficiency gains through improvement  type , such as gains due to compressors , chillers , boilers , etc . if this is  indeed the case , then we need to have distributions for each type of  improvement .  if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it  systems , then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system . it  would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel  workbooks . it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run  simulations and queries , but this would probably take me about five or six  weeks .  finally , don hawkins does operational audits for enron ' s physical assets .  he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets . i don ' t  think that he does it for ees , but you might want to give him a call anyway .  - kevin k .  ps : the ees lunch meeting has been moved to wednesdays . jay hachen will  know more .",0,ees operational risk per conversation model simon notes gave work back september looking volume numbers notes show drives final cash flow numbers briefly issue surrounds exactly meant nonmarket noncredit risk ideally would anything effects npv deal however think limit things effect time amount eam volumes even problem set quite large glance spreadsheet model notice exists large number possible items effect eam volumes rigorously necessary tear apart ees business model although attempt would noble scope excercise may large need clear definition ees operational risk briefly ees deals looked two things drive profit long term bet power prices go improve facility various enhancements may gleaned spreadsheet well assumptions regarding funding facility improvements savings assumed come power gas effeciency gain may explicitly given data show realized efficiency gains would simple principle determine distribution hence distribution eam volumes npv etc time understand rac determined realized efficiency gains knowledge quite sketchy jay hachen may info get chance try see proof concept excercise late january deadline something else another point even successful spreadsheet model ees chosen book things differently thorough understanding systems least principle spreadsheet model environment data data data may book efficiency gains improvement type gains due compressors chillers boilers etc indeed case need distributions type improvement successful spreadsheet successful systems alternative build reporting system would similar database recordsets replaced excel workbooks constructed way enable us run simulations queries would probably take five six weeks finally hawkins operational audits enron physical assets sends teams audit pipelines strategic assets think ees might want give call anyway kevin k ps ees lunch meeting moved wednesdays jay hachen know

"Subject: b 2 b at enron  tom ,  i am sending you the information about our new b 2 b unit .  i have talked yesterday with greg whalley who is heading the new  unit about the e - commerce project at wharton and recommended that enron join  this program .  i have sent him this morning a copy of the materials you gave me .  the meeting with jeff skilling has been pushed till the 2 nd half of july .  i talked to him briefly twice that jeff shankman and i want to discuss with  him building a relationship with wharton . jeff shankman is , by the way , a  great friend of  your institution .  vince  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  companies & finance : the americas : enron sees bricks and  bytes mix reshaping energy market : purchase of mg only  a start in  building b 2 b platforms , writes hillary durgin :  companies financial times ; 16 - jun - 2000 12 : 00 : 00 am ;  604 words  by hillary durgin  if jeffrey skilling is right ,  enron ' s acquisition of mg is only the tip of the iceberg .  enron ' s president and  chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental  strategy shift at the  houston energy company , aimed at making it a dominant  "" new economy ""  player across various industrial markets .  the dollars 446 m acquisition last month of mg , the  uk - based metals trader ,  is only the first of more than dollars lbn in estimated  new investments the  company is targeting . it is seeking vehicles on which to  build  business - to - business ( b 2 b ) platforms in sectors such as  logistics , chemicals ,  agricultural products and pulp & paper .  mr skilling wants to take the business model the company  developed in  natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale  commodity markets . he  argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only  become the principal  b 2 b sites for those sectors , but reshape those  industries .  as an example , he points to enron ' s new e - commerce  platform , enrononline ,  which has changed the way the company does business with  its customers  while significantly increasing sales .  the company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural  gas and power - saw  wholesale , physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53  per cent in the first  quarter .  critics argue that enron ' s move away from its familiar  energy business into  new industries , where the learning curve is steep and the  competition  entrenched , is risky . yet a number of industry analysts  point out enron has  proved it understands markets and how to manage risks  while becoming the  largest importer of coal in the uk , the largest trader of  gas and power in the  us and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth .  "" it ' s a prudent strategy , but it ' s got to be done in an  orderly way , "" says ronald  barone , analyst with paine - webber in new york . "" what  they ' re doing here is  what they ' ve been incredibly successful at doing , "" he  adds , noting that enron  posted dollars 1 . 3 bn in earnings before interest and  taxes ( ebit ) from its  wholesale energy and services business in 1999 , up 34 per  cent from the  previous year .  earnings from that division accounted for two - thirds of  the company ' s overall  income before interest and taxes last year , and mr barone  sees the unit ' s ebit  increasing 15 - 30 per cent annually over several years .  as with gas and power and now broadband , where enron is  standardising  contracts and creating a market in bandwidth , it wants to  create markets by  entering as a physical player and providing merchant ,  risk management and  financial services over the internet .  "" we will provide electronic commerce , but we will provide  liquidity and we will  provide settlement , or fulfilment of that contract , "" mr  skilling says . "" that is an  extremely powerful model . if you look at other b 2 b sites ,  they don ' t do that . ""  mr skilling argues enron ' s e - commerce platform will  triumph over the other ,  bulletin board - type exchanges , where striking a deal  depends on two parties  hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing ,  price , credit and  fulfilment .  not everyone shares that view . some energy companies , for  example , would  rather not do business with a competitor . bp amoco  recently purchased a 3  per cent stake in altra energy technologies , a houston -  based , neutral  wholesale energy exchange . with koch industries and  american electric  power , it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of  transactions on the  site to lend it liquidity .  just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals ,  enron believes it  needs networks of strategic physical assets . in acquiring  mg , enron got a  stable of warehouses , lending it a strong physical  position .  "" it should provide ( mg ) with a more vibrant , more active  physical spot market  in more markets in the world , "" says greg whalley , chief  executive officer of  enron net works , the new division enron is launching to  identify and enter  commodity markets . he argues that in metals and other  markets , enron will  deliver better pricing , price risk management services ,  cross - commodity  transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range  of customers .  mr skilling says there are significant rewards for  restructuring an industry .

at - risk systems . in addition , vince has received the 1999 james h .  mcgraw award for energy risk management ( energy risk manager of the year )  and is well published . he is the key contributor to a best - selling  publication by risk books entitled : managing energy price risk .  our meeting was mainly focused on gaining additional insights re  leading - edge practices within ene . my key findings are summarized below :  1 . ene does not use corporate price premises . they use market price info  only and adhere to mark - to - market accounting .  2 . ene uses the "" heath , jarrow , and morton "" methods for modeling price  dynamics ( i ' ve asked bic for a copy of the associated paper ) . they have  their own "" home - grown "" software , however , they periodically review selected  external developments for internal inclusion and advancement .  3 . vince ' s group comprises of mathematicians , physicists , and operations  researchers who are responsible for the development and advancement of  ene ' s  risk management tools . these models are religiously used by the traders ,  risk managers , and bus across ene .  4 . investment proposals are screened , risked , and "" roved "" by a separate  corporate group ( similar to our special studies and with business and real  options skills ) who work in conjunction with the bus . all evaluations and  transactions are marked - to - market .  5 . ene does not use efficient - frontier portfolio concepts . they "" vc fund ""  any opportunity that has a credible value proposition and can stand on its  own . they believe that with the current plentiful liquidity in the market ,  project - financing in not an issue for a "" good "" opportunity . however , they  closely monitor the development of each opportunity , within their deep  portfolio , at the corporate level and know how to "" fail fast "" .  6 . the employee reward system is based on p & ls as well as the creation of  new business .  7 . most employees have stock options .  i really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with vince again the next time  i ' m in houston .",0,houston visit thank much prompt reply pls let know going ny otherwise look forward seeing soon houston soussan original message vince j kaminski enron com mailto vince j kaminski enron com sent tuesday april faizs texaco com subject houston visit soussan looks fine look forward meeting houston new york vince faiz soussan vince j kaminski enron com cc subject houston visit dear vince firstly really appreciate time meeting last week learning enron use leading edge practices quite enlightening truly benefited visit secondly summarized key take aways stated conveying management however really appreciate pls review conclusions ensure miss stated thanks much time wisdom also honored gave copy managing energy price risk book shall reference interest thank really look forward seeing next time houston best regards soussan ps latest fortune article ene great read substantiates company innovative creative approach business may know invited visit enron ene last week met vince kaminski vp head research risk management group ene vince used salomon brothers brain ene w r analytical tools pricing commodities hedging optimization financial physical transactions well value risk systems addition vince received james h mcgraw award energy risk management energy risk manager year well published key contributor best selling publication risk books entitled managing energy price risk meeting mainly focused gaining additional insights leading edge practices within ene key findings summarized ene use corporate price premises use market price info adhere mark market accounting ene uses heath jarrow morton methods modeling price dynamics asked bic copy associated paper home grown software however periodically review selected external developments internal inclusion advancement vince group comprises mathematicians physicists operations researchers responsible development advancement ene risk management tools models religiously used traders risk managers bus across ene investment proposals screened risked roved separate corporate group similar special studies business real options skills work conjunction bus evaluations transactions marked market ene use efficient frontier portfolio concepts vc fund opportunity credible value proposition stand believe current plentiful liquidity market project financing issue good opportunity however closely monitor development opportunity within deep portfolio corporate level know fail fast employee reward system based p ls well creation new business employees stock options really enjoyed visit hope meet vince next time houston

( in high speed communication bandwidth scenarios , for example ,  the dimensions could be price , bandwidth size , time for which bandwidth  available , continguity of the allocation , and such . )  2 ) it involves dynamic matching as opposed to "" static "" matching .  3 ) it is multi - lateral .  4 ) it adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions .  5 ) it allows traders to make important trade - offs , as they do in  traditional markets .  currently , skg is involved in discussions with the heads of trading at  fidelity , putnam investments , lehman bros . , kpmg , meridien research ,  salomon smith barney , jp morgan , state street , banc of america , mckinsey ,  citizens power , and a host of other folks .  we think we have a value - adding service to provide to enron online or any  other enron subsidiary that the skg offering matches and that you deem fit .  skg ' s founders and i will be very happy to provide you or your  representative ( s ) with more details , including a demo of the prototype , in  a meeting . we are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange  something appropriate .  thanks very much , jeff ! we look forward to hearing from you .  with warm regards ,  joseph cherian and robert jarrow  cc : professor robert c . merton  joseph a . cherian  associate professor of finance  boston university school of management  595 commonwealth avenue , room 522 h  boston , ma 02215  tel : 617 - 353 - 2679 ( o )  617 - 353 - 6667 ( fax )",0,greg fyi jeff asked forward review srs forwarded sherri sera corp enron pm joseph cherian jeffrey k skilling cc vince j kaminski robert jarrow robert c merton subject mr jeffrey k skilling president c enron corp dear jeff email robert jarrow cornell joe cherian hope recall meeting lunching bob jarrow keynoted math finance day conference boston university wanted introduce skg inc startup focused providing innovative service electronic trading community messers kuppuswamy seshadhri sriketan mahanti gaurav mallik principal founders skg inc bob jarrow represent company scientific advisory board nobel laureate robert merton also sat table keynote address kindly serves ad hoc senior advisor skg invaluable resource skg including putting us touch jp morgan coincidentally c jp morgan capital corp ed colloton april meeting told us would introduce us c f enron online knows felt skg would huge value adding opportunities however given ed busy travel schedule believe able yet hence joint decision bob jarrow send email skg solution provide dynamic pricing value maximization electronic trading securities commodities ecns atss alternative trading systems achieves process strategic negotiation using automated agents intelligent software manifestations system viewed ecn rather enhancement extant trading system ecn ats clob nasdaq etc initial system design conducted financial instruments trading e g bonds equities strategy much applicable energy power instruments trading high speed communications bandwidth trading web based commodities trading believe interest enron online skg superior existing solutions following way considers multiple attributes e g price time volatility bandwidth high speed communication bandwidth scenarios example dimensions could price bandwidth size time bandwidth available continguity allocation involves dynamic matching opposed static matching multi lateral adapts dynamically changing market conditions allows traders make important trade offs traditional markets currently skg involved discussions heads trading fidelity putnam investments lehman bros kpmg meridien research salomon smith barney jp morgan state street banc america mckinsey citizens power host folks think value adding service provide enron online enron subsidiary skg offering matches deem fit skg founders happy provide representative details including demo prototype meeting therefore hopeful able arrange something appropriate thanks much jeff look forward hearing warm regards joseph cherian robert jarrow cc professor robert c merton joseph cherian associate professor finance boston university school management commonwealth avenue room h boston tel fax

"Subject: marketpoint license agreement  john / vince :  i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross  section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank  you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people .  as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for  marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your  consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire  bundled product , which includes  ? north american gas , short and long term  ? north american electricity , short and long term  ? world gas  ? western european gas  ? world oil  we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european  gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into  marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of  months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are  presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an  attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout  your worldwide business .  as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will  want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at  the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately  the fully  bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the  software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the  electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas  model plus the data for  the software license plus the data license for a  total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under  the fully bundled price . i  think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from  marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward  together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another  model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you  up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas  decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  - license . doc",0,marketpoint license agreement john vince really enjoyed meeting day broad cross section people thank much setting thank giving opportunity speak people mentioned john sending license paperwork marketpoint attached standard license agreement consideration mentioned license agreement covers entire bundled product includes north american gas short long term north american electricity short long term world gas western european gas world oil finishing porting world oil world gas western european gas models old obsolete software system marketpoint fully tested complete couple months however gas electricity models north america presently complete tested allow us give attractive price full worldwide toolkit available throughout worldwide business understood want gas modeling capability first want defer decisions electric capability mentioned meeting prepared offer approximately fully bundled price read license agreement see software licenses annually gas data electric data marketpoint agree license gas model plus data software license plus data license total annually fully bundled price think consistent discussions meeting marketpoint perspective would provide great basis move forward together enron enron ever desires scale another model model marketpoint portfolio simply scale entire license agreement allow decouple gas decision decisions might make glad put additional pricing provision agreement decide move forward felt able communicate philosophy scope operation approach meeting deliver much information might need evaluate whether marketpoint meets needs thought able see depth sophistication product yet time simplicity effectiveness thought able see benefits marketpoint dimension economic equilibrium complement supplement approaches assuredly use would interested impressions colleagues look forward response moving ahead together view important prospective customer client work earn secure business decide license marketpoint arrange transfer mount marketpoint short term narg model model suggest begin travel houston deliver day training seminar clients usually fluent day training seminar thereafter would want work short term narg model weeks get speed fluent comfortable take delivery longer term version narg several weeks later thanks best item meeting might forgotten send please remind notes show anything speaking lot rather writing notes meeting might overlooked something someone wanted dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc adonna ct los altos hills ca dale nesbitt marketpointinc com license doc

"Subject: possible rtp conference  dear mr . kaminski :  thank you for talking with me about a possible rtp conference . i would  like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries .  as i indicated , frank wolak suggested that i contact you . in discussing  power markets with frank and other colleagues at stanford and epri , it  seems quite evident that real - time pricing for retail customers is the  "" forgotten resource "" in more efficient power markets . there seems to be a  lot of confusion about what rtp means and it also seems that many  researchers need to address some practical but important problems . i was  asked whether a group like stanford ' s emf might explore this topic and give  it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by  policymakers .  frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a  useful approach and who might also see whether enron could become a major  sponsor . i was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to enron  that the company might consider providing $ 25 , 000 . as you may appreciate ,  it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the  conference is widely circulated among key government groups .  i would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and  recommendations for people ( perhaps yourself or a colleague ) to  participate . i would also appreciate any consideration by enron of  providing funding for this effort .  thank you ,  hill huntington  - retail notes . rtf  hillard g . huntington  emf - an international forum on  energy and environmental markets voice : ( 650 ) 723 - 1050  408 terman center fax : ( 650 ) 725 - 5362  stanford university email : hillh @ stanford . edu  stanford , ca 94305 - 4026  emf website : http : / / www . stanford . edu / group / emf /",0,possible rtp conference dear mr kaminski thank talking possible rtp conference would like include discussions learned industries indicated frank wolak suggested contact discussing power markets frank colleagues stanford epri seems quite evident real time pricing retail customers forgotten resource efficient power markets seems lot confusion rtp means also seems many researchers need address practical important problems asked whether group like stanford emf might explore topic give visibility would considered seriously policymakers frank thought might someone could help structure useful approach might also see whether enron could become major sponsor hoping issue sufficiently important enron company might consider providing may appreciate requires thought effort make sure product conference widely circulated among key government groups would interested hearing provide ideas recommendations people perhaps colleague participate would also appreciate consideration enron providing funding effort thank hill huntington retail notes rtf hillard g huntington emf international forum energy environmental markets voice terman center fax stanford university email hillh stanford edu stanford ca emf website http www stanford edu group emf

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self -

"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .",0,california update following report contains confidential sensitive information please treat discretion executive summary ferc price cap decision reflects bush political economic objectives politically bush determined let crisis blame fall davis economic perspective unwilling create disincentives new power generation davis finds four major flaws ferc plan notably exclusion state generators june lst kill clause ferc order could coincide new bush regional plan california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill summer economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement qf bid advance payments pg e likely fail bankruptcy court new generation delays probable state qf squabbling consumer groups preparing constitutional challenge socal bailout deal ferc fallout ferc decision holding move bush administration looks like action rather allows situation california continue develop virtually unabated political strategy appears allow situation deteriorate point davis escape shouldering blame politically inoculated administration begin look regional solutions moreover administration already made explicit certainly restate forthcoming cheney commission report opposition stronger price caps grounds unwilling create disincentives construction new generation interesting ironic note electricity generators generally happy ferc order ferc commissioner favors price caps actually voted plan something less effective price caps davis point view ferc plan four major flaws order applies california rest west non california generators required sell capped rates california order written price floor emergency power ceiling state officials also believe energy suppliers continue game system price mitigation scheme kicks stage emergency require collusion even price caps kick based cost plus highest cost producer supplying power california require wholesalers abide cap generators also charge cap provided subsequently justify excess charge ferc proposal kill clause adds political dilemma davis ferc proposal includes kill clause says caps withdrawn unless california iso agrees june lst become part regional grid ferc control davis sign regional grid june lst live june nd headlines blaming letting bush price caps plan collapse growing fiscal risk california sources speculate california could therefore pay much billion power summer combined enterprise value pg e sce sources believe severity situation ferc federal government forced take action control prices power consensus state california run money days one first projects cancelled state plans finance new power plant construction exchange long term power deals bleak fiscal picture also causing bank creditors revisit bridge loans providing california bush administration fed waking seriousness fiscal picture country largest prosperous state gone large surpluses serious debt downgrades devastating deficits matter months qfs seek advance payment pg e meanwhile bankruptcy front qfs reportedly ask bankruptcy judge today give advance payment pge accounts since natural gas vendors likewise demanded advance payment gas appears unlikely qfs request granted qfs receive advance payment likely mw gas fired qf capacity remain offline delays likely new qf generation qf deals made state long term contracts continually renegotiated likely mean new plants contracts supposed finance online early anticipated consumer groups ready challenge constitutionality sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield colleagues reportedly reviewing analysis mou sce bailout plan analysis done utilities analyst rather lawyer though appears raise number good legal points example one elements mou non bypassable charge ratepayers would require pay even disconnect grid effectively tax since exchange value money ca constitution used directly benefit private entity makes bonds would issued general obligation bonds rather revenue bonds according constitution state put debt benefit private company reasons even republicans would vote sce bailout remains unlikely bailout probably would stand likely constitutional challenge governor hurt continued failure disclose long term power contracts issue governor failure disclose details long term power contracts continues distress players crisis even disclose everything staff negotiating likely actions negotiations challenged creating even delay

"Subject: letter from : daniel kabila  letter from : daniel kabila  investment offer .  dear ,  in appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source  and the choice of your country i wish to introduce myself , i am daniel kabila  the son of the late drc president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory .  i know this letter might come to you as a surprise but i honestly do not  intend to surprise you . i write this letter in respect of my intention to  invest the sum of us $ 12 m ( twelve million united state dollars ) with you . i  inherited this money from my mother . this money was got through the smuggling  and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state . my  mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in  the  business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend  on how much she can get out of the privilege situation .  when my father was assassinated on 16 th jan . 01 by one of his bodyguards  lt . rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that  wanted to topple him i escaped to sa because of the fear that i might be  arrested by my half brother lt . general joseph kabila the present head of  state . actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship  because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately  affected us their children . considering the relationship between sa and my  country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security  reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad .  on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee  i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money  out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you  because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as  a  political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this  money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother  has  seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed  without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad  so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best  investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of  investing this money with your help .  in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to  respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future .  and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort  in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after  tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the term  shall be varied . 5 % for expenses , which may arise during the transaction (  fax  and phone bills inclusive ) . when the money is moved into your discrete  account , you will be allowed to draw 15 % in your favor , while the remaining  80 % will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area  of  business and deterrents sectors of the economy in your country which are  dividends yielding .  whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my email , and  keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family .  best regards ,  daniel kabila",1,letter daniel kabila letter daniel kabila investment offer dear appreciation esteemed contact received reliable source choice country wish

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

"" breakthrough "" products in the vspc pipeline  vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons .  another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors .  significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries  in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today .  vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade .  another analogy is the  flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business .  in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the "" flashlight battery "" - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each .  vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east .  intellectual property protected with patents  vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents .  strategic partners lend credibility  to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources .  vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc .  for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office .  "" fabless "" business model enables cost - effective growth  fabless semiconductor chip companies design and develop proprietary chips , then outsource manufacturing to wafer plants in the far east . some well - known fabless semiconductor companies , ranked by market capitalization , include  $ 12 billion market cap , broadcom ( brcm )  press here to view  $ 11 billion market cap , marvell semiconductor ( mrvl )  press here to view  $ 9 billion market cap , xilinx ( xlnx )  press here to view  $ 7 . 3 billion market cap , altera ( altr )  press here to view  $ 4 . 5 billion market cap , nvidia corp ( nvda )  press here to view  $ 4 . 4 billion market cap , sandisk corp ( sndk )  press here to view  $ 3 billion market cap , ati technologies ( atyt )  press here to view  ( other technologies products to be discussed in future analyst report updates )  vspc expects to use emerging computational , rf , imaging and nanosensor technologies to drive market growth by enabling gps - free navigation , especially for where gps doesn ' t work - - a top dod priority ; automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging - - for homeland security applications ; and identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons .  when appropriate we will also provide updates on projects currently under review , which include a water purification technology and interactive radio .  management  chief executive officer :  dr . carl kukkonen , ceo and founding partner .  prior to founding viaspace technologies llc , dr . kukkonen was director of the center for space microelectronics technology ( csmt ) and manager of supercomputing at the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , ca . at jpl , dr . kukkonen managed several technologies and technical teams , including the technical foundation of viaspace ' s operating subsidiaries .  among his major accomplishments , dr . kukkonen built the center for space microelectronics into a 250 man operation with a $ 70 m annual budget from nothing over the course of his 14 -

"Subject: re : wall street micro news report  homeland security investments  the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have  changed  the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and  logical  security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in  the  banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga ,  a  wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for  information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by  2005 .  homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing  our  readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this  lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security  happen  with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position  ourselves in  such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to  capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security  investments is here to help our readers do just that .  with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble ,  inc .  this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long  terms .  symbol : ( vnbl )  current price : 0 . 08  short term target price : 0 . 35  12 month target price : 1 . 20  * * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * *  * at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency  identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors  to  transmit information about a person or object wirelessly .  * vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location  technology .  * vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies  and  governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such  technology  has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials  designated "" high risk "" were they to fall into the wrong hands .  * vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order  to  create "" high security space "" in locales where it is deemed necessary .  locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea  ports ,  mines , nuclear facilities , and more .  * as with all stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has  made vnbl a hot buy .  news on vnbl  malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2005 - - vinoble , inc .  ( otcbb : vnbl -  news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and  other  security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that will assist in the automation of the identification and  control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in  the  oil & gas and petrochemical industries .  although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they  can  also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,  such as  a well filling with water .  as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide  the  safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the  entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is  essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would  enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or  danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid  can  also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and  chemical  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .  vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective  measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against  threat .  preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  u . s .  industry and economy .  the company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position  vinoble in  a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the company will require  for  growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to  do  without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of  constant threat .  this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is  exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly  innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .  information within this email contains "" forward looking statements ""  within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and  section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that  express or involve discussions with respect to predictions ,  expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals ,  assumptions or  future  events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be  "" forward looking statements .

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well -

gear and the expanding production on  reserves worth muiti - miilions , eogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the  vaiue of its assets .  4 . emerson oi | and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn  unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . already  shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market .  in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the  past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and  deveiopers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in  the last 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and even quadrupie  returns .  our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued  eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company  with a comparably smail market vaiue , is sitting on a bonanza of oil  and gas reserves -

the great thing about  investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in  the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or deciine  siightly , you will stiil make a very heaithy return . of course , energy  prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year  or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings  wiil soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wiil be  staggering .  overall , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy  plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,  eogi shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have  identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oil and  gas reserves are well established and are going into massive  production . early investors wi | | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in  this area wi | | realiy turn up the heat , causing us to revise our  targets upward in next week ' s builetin .  oi | and gas advisory ( oga ) is not a investment expert . certain  statements contained in this newsletter may be future -

"Subject: commercialization of nasa technology  hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace  the cohen report  viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity .  direct liquid methanol fuel cell  direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc .  the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers .  arroyo sciences , inc .  arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments .  the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe .  deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo .  ionfinity  ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up .  additional projects under review  projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus .  forecasts and valuation  we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis .  directors and management  dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company .  aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation .  dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri .  viaspace overview  viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce .  viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems .  viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories .  the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk .  viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate .  in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power .  viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors  ( www . spectrasensors . com ) , qwip technologies  ( www . qwip . com ) , and vialogy corp ( www . vialogy . com ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries -

"Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head . ""  finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting "" infrastructure "" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : shanbhogue , vasant  sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm  to : mack , iris  cc : dhar , amitava  subject : london work  hi iris ,  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ?  vasant",0,fw london work hi london seems left august sun cold serious looking people expensive etc addition may day riots post office bombing train strike etc mention excitement enron credit would nice know supposed reporting getting loads conflicting messages illustrated forwarded email vasant according slava strategy paper duffie report seems higher priority however vasant seems indicate forwarded email priority moment addition seems lots chaos enron credit houston office even london office brings mind russian proverb learned slava expressed views current state enron credit fish rots head finally would like know exactly want write duffie report want hear enron credit would like hear need us develop private firm model exisiting infrastructure want hear really see hear read etc latter true may need write two reports learning look good would probably make enron credit personnel happy well think said enough look forward feedback thanks iris original message shanbhogue vasant sent friday may pm mack iris cc dhar amitava subject london work hi iris amitava must told getting swamped work result expect take lead scoping enron credit project making sure infrastructure readied also make sure understand econometric data analysis software side project probably important preparing document duffie right definitely sit ben george actually run software get feel used also need able try potential ways analyzing data amitava help best answer direct questions limited time review documents etc expect amitava get heavily involved data starts coming expect already set infrastructure etc data hope trip going well would extending trip time vasant

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .  this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

"Subject: linux - - hit or miss ?  network world fusion focus : phil hochmuth  on linux  today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ?  03 / 15 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss  on the corporate desktop ?  by phil hochmuth  so far this year , the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has  focused on servers and embedded systems , with the growth of linux  severs being most heralded . according to idc , a research firm based in  framingham , mass . , linux was the fastest - growing server operating  system last year , with a 93 % growth rate over the year before . linux  was the second most - shipped operating system in 1999 after windows nt ,  capturing 24 % of new licenses shipped .  as for the embedded market , linux has emerged as an ideal platform for  network appliances , because the system can be modified to handle  specialized , dedicated tasks very well . companies such as cobalt  networks , picazo and progressive systems have announced linux - based  appliances , ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls .  but what of the open source hacker  , s dream of  & linux on every desktop ?  8  sure , linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever , with  colorful , shrink - wrapped boxes of caldera , red hat and corel linux now  available at places like compusa . however , analysts have said that  linux  , s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro  areas of network servers and embedded operating systems .  according to idc , linux currently runs on only 4 % of u . s . desktops . the  hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong ,  analysts say , despite such factors as microsoft  , s antitrust problems  and the surging popularity of linux .  even some linux executives are skeptical of their product  , s desktop  future . recently , suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux  , s future on  desktops . dyroff said ,  & given the lack of applications available , we  really can ' t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet .  8  a recent survey by survey . com gives more hope for linux desktops .  according to the survey of 1 , 640 enterprise network managers , open  source operating systems are used on 10 % of desktops , with the number  jumping to a surprising 23 % of enterprise desktops by 2002 .  despite the mix of numbers being thrown around , two important factors  that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client  desktop are : a standardized , easy - to - use graphical user interface ( gui )  and available applications .  one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo  alto - based eazel , which is designing a next - generation file management  system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel . according  to eazel  , s web site , the company  , s goal is to bring linux to the masses  and  & do it in a way that appeals to today ' s linux users and to mere  mortals .  8  the company was founded by a group of former apple executives , and is  allied with the gnome project , which has been doing extensive linux  desktop environment development for several years . eazel is due to have  a product out by the middle of this year . with an intuitive , icon - based  file management environment , eazel is hoping its user interface will be  an improvement over the two current linux guis , gnome and kde , and will  help standardized the look and feel of linux for  & regular  8 users . for  enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side ,  this development will be worth keeping an eye on .  on the applications side , several office productivity suites have been  available for some time , such as sun  , s staroffice suite and koffice for  the kde desktop . corel has also ported its office products , such as  wordperfect , over to linux to complement its own distribution of the  operating system . while there have been recent rumors ( started by linux  care vice president arthur tyde ) that microsoft is working on a port of  ms office to linux , microsoft officials deny this .  while linux may never supplant windows as the industry - standard desktop ,  there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets  in the future .  to contact phil hochmuth :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  phil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world , and a former  systems integrator . you can reach him at mailto : phochmut @ nww . com .  for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :  http : / / www . nwfusion . com  staroffice software from sun  http : / / www . sun . com / staroffice  corel linux os  http : / / www . corel . com / freedom / freedom . htm  eazel  http : / / www . eazel . com  gnome - - the gnu network object model environment  http : / / www . gnome . org  koffice - - the integrated office suite for kde , the k desktop  environment  http : / / koffice . kde . org /  cobalt networks , inc .  http : / / www . cobaltnetworks . com  progressive systems  http : / / www . progressive - systems . com  picazo  http : / / www . picazo . com  other linux - related articles from network world :  active directory upgrade requires strong game plan , network world ,  03 / 13 / 00  subscription services  to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,  go to :  to change your email address , go to :  subscription questions ?

""  2 . debt restructuring - guarantees , but no direct state money  davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $ 12 billion in back  debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up  during a 90 - day forbearance period ( whether that period has been agreed to by  all creditors is not something we are clear about right now ) . davis ' idea , as  he laid it out in the meeting , is to use the forbearance period to securitize  the debts and sell them against the utilities ' forward rate base or by  establishing a  medium - term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees .  in both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without  direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to  paydown their debt . one of the reasons davis wants to stay close to the  $ 50 - $ 55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can  pay  down this debt . there is a strong chance that davis will agree to use state  guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations , but he remains  opposed to using direct state money . this frustrates both clinton  administration and utility creditors , but davis has not yet shown much  flexibility .  3 . eminent domain / reregulation  perhaps most frustrating to the washington dc free market crowd at treasury  and the white house was the continued comfort davis and his group of political  advisers have with "" non - market "" solutions to the energy crisis . although  the governor ' s aides actually believe the weapon is more a "" way to force  eventual  agreement , than an actual solution , "" the talk returns frequently to these  non - market mechanisms . "" we have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by  the  tuesday deadline . if we make no progress . if this thing looks like it will  turn into a genuine crisis , then we will use our powers of condemnation and  we will re - take  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves , "" a close political aide to  davis said .

features since version 2 . 0 .  @ energy ( forward curve ) no change .  @ energy ( basics ) a control variate methodology hull ( 1997 ) has been  implemented for valuation of american options ( opt ) , black and  mean - reverting models . it greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in  speed . all models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to  parallel displacement delta , hedge , and gamma . average price / strike options  now support an alternative way of computing theta . the definition of gamma  curves has been modified for all models .  @ energy ( advanced ) a faster and more accurate methodology is used to value  spread options . models affected are spreadopt , stripspreadopt , optspreadopt ,  optstripspreadopt . the new methodology dramatically improves speed . all  models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel  displacement delta , hedge , and gamma . average price / strike options now  support an alternative way of computing theta . the definition of gamma  curves has been modified for all models .  @ energy ( swing ) the definition of gamma curves has been modified for all  models .  @ energy ( weather ) no change .  see the file fea \ energy \ ergnote . txt in your distribution for a list of bug  fixes .  here is an overview of the new and changed features since version 1 . 6 .  @ energy ( forward curve )  jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ energy functions .  inputs and outputs to powercalib and comcalib have changed . see the  corresponding function syntax in the user guide for additional information .  35 - 40 % speed improvement . the module is now out of beta .  @ energy ( basics )  different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported . if you  use indexswap , exoticswap , or optindexswap with floating price linked to a  series of futures dates , such futures dates need not be close to dates  specified in the forward curve input . a new utility function , pathutil ,  allows you to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models  supported by @ energy . 25 - 30 % speed improvement .  @ energy ( advanced )  different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported . if you  use optdiffswap or diffswap with floating price linked to a series of  futures dates , such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in  the forward curve input . calspreadopt now allows for the specification of  two different mean reversion rates . 30 - 35 % speed improvement .  @ energy ( swing )  swingopt and stripswingopt now allow for valuation of swing straddle  contracts with overall load constraints . 65 - 70 % speed improvement . the  module is now out of beta .  @ energy ( weather )  30 - 35 % speed improvement .  see the file fea \ energy

"Subject: re : full version  i read the chapter . generally ,  i like it , and find it non - controversial  and well written . of course , this is  a huge topic and there are things  that you haven ' t discussed .  i thought the amount of attention  paid to ols and mle estimation  was a bit overboard , given that you  didn ' t really exploit it in your  results . if you were to state  the likelihood function for  the garch model , it might justify  the amount of attention to  gave to estimation for  simple iid processes , which could then  be thought of as a simple lead - in  and intuition builder to  the more interesting models that  you do actually use .  by the way , in your discussion of  smiles , you discuss fat tails  extensively . at least for equity markets ,  while fat tails contribute , they don ' t do very  much at all compared to the effect  of risk premia , which you allude to briefly ,  using supply - demand language , at the  end of that section .  for the impact of risk premia , see  jun pan ' s paper , which is available  from her web page . but she covers  only sp 500 , ( as do most studies ) ,  and your markets are obviously much different .  the chapter will be a good service to your readers !

"Subject: mark - to - market  bob ,  i wanted to continue the analysis on mark - to - market that i had spoken to you  about on the phone .  i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction  by phone , so i am having krishnarao who is in vince ' s group explain the  transaction to you .  krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india , and he has just  returned to houston from india after working with the team here .  he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction . i would  like you to please spend some time with him , and then based on the discussion  please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to  market .  please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from  the indian side . this is a very important transaction for us , and we may  need to repeat this in coming months , hence setting up the system to account  for these maybe well worth it . also , what i am concerned about is that there  will be an enron india ( eipl ) account in india based on indian gaap , and upon  consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us . it is here that  we would like to have mark - to - market accounting . eipl is structured through  mauritius , and then caymen islands .  another key question to consider is that when we m - t - m the transaction in the  us there will be a tax accruing in the year of m - t - m ( say 2000 ) . however , in  india , as a result of the accrual accounting , there will not be any income  showing till the year 2002 or 2003 . we will need to know how that would get  treated , and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the  us . i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied , since none of  the income is being brought back into the us ( remains overseas - subpart - f  and other concerns ) .  finally , we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and  getting a fixed for floating swap in the us ( this is still not allowed to  indian corporates ) . i need you to think about this too , and see if some type  of accounting will solve this issue . krishna knows what i am talking about ,  and will brief you on the same .  krishna - please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here .  look forward to your help and comments . this is going to be an exciting  project for us all .  regards ,  sandeep .",0,mark market bob wanted continue analysis mark market spoken phone thought getting difficult explaining whole transaction phone krishnarao vince group explain transaction krishna helping us structure deal india returned houston india working team seek appointment explain transaction would like please spend time based discussion please send us note detailing sucha transaction would marked market please cosider fact currently transactions indian side important transaction us may need repeat coming months hence setting system account maybe well worth also concerned enron india eipl account india based indian gaap upon consolidation us gaap accounting us would like mark market accounting eipl structured mauritius caymen islands another key question consider transaction us tax accruing year say however india result accrual accounting income showing till year need know would get treated whether way get credit tax payable us also confused whether us tax would levied since none income brought back us remains overseas subpart f concerns finally working hard structuring fixed price contract getting fixed floating swap us still allowed indian corporates need think see type accounting solve issue krishna knows talking brief krishna please walk bob three structures worked look forward help comments going exciting project us regards sandeep
